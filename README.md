# CALCULATOR-ZADA

In this project I used many concepts learned so far as simple HTML, CSS and JS codes, I thought of using bootstrap for styling but I thought it was better to use pure CSS.
The only difference is a library of numerical letters that I inserted after the css to show the numbers in the digital format that I found on the internet, the result is really cool.
I hope you like it if you have any ideas to improve you can "commit" kk
